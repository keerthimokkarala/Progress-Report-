Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

I created the code so that the image I chose bounces to the beat of a song that I chose.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I did the bare minimum, so now I want to add some flare, like add some color to the background, add a trail to the image, and make it where the image is moving to the background instead of it just having the image move in a box. 


#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?
The hardest part was me trying to make the image move to the beat of a song, but after a lot of trial and error, I got it.
